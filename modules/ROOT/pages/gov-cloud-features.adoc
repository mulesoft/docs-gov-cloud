Government Cloud includes the full functionality of the runtime plane (services and Mule runtime engine) and a subset of the control plane (browser management) Anypoint Platform features.

You must configure Mule to run in FIPS-compliant mode. See xref:mule-runtime::fips-140-2-compliance-support.adoc[FIPS 140-2 Compliance Support].

Although it is not part of Government Cloud, you can use Anypoint Studio offline to build applications to deploy in Government Cloud. See xref:studio::set-credentials-in-studio-to.adoc[Configuring Anypoint Platform Credentials].
