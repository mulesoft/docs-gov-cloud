MuleSoft Government Cloud includes the full functionality of the Anypoint Platform runtime plane (services and Mule runtime engine) and a subset of the Anypoint Platform control plane (browser-based management of APIs and Mule runtime engine instances) functionality. Government Cloud supports the full API-led connectivity methodology and end-to-end API lifecycle management.

MuleSoft Government Cloud supports Mule runtime engine v3.9 and later, with some restrictions:

* Because MuleSoft Government Cloud does not support Mule agents with self-signed certificates, specific versions of Mule agents are required:

** Mule 3: v1.12.0 and later (supported only for cloud deployments)
** Mule 4: v2.2.0 and later

For more information about creating servers with FIPS support, refer to xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[Add Servers to Runtime Manager].

By default, Mule runtime engine is configured to run in FIPS-compliant mode. See xref:mule-runtime::fips-140-2-compliance-support.adoc[FIPS 140-2 Compliance Support] for additional information.

Although Anypoint Studio is not part of Government Cloud, you can use Anypoint Studio offline to build applications and then manually deploy them to Government Cloud.
