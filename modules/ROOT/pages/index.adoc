= Government Cloud Overview
:page-aliases: gov-cloud-features.adoc

MuleSoft Government Cloud is a secure, FedRAMP-moderate certified deployment environment that enables government agencies to use Anypoint Platform in the cloud.

Your agency might already use Anypoint Platform on-premises to build applications. With Government Cloud, you can leverage the integration platform as a service (iPaaS) to reduce the infrastructure and management costs associated with legacy on-premises integration.

With MuleSoft managing the Anypoint Platform infrastructure, your IT teams can focus on designing integrations. You can manage and monitor all government integration assets from a single secure, cloud-based management console.

[IMPORTANT]
MuleSoft Government Cloud deployment permits deployment of Mule runtime engine instances into an on-premises environment (standalone Mule instances). Standalone Mule instances, and
MuleSoft support for standalone Mules, are outside the scope of FedRAMP. The customer is responsible for ensuring that all data shared with Salesforce complies
with any and all data and information protection policies, requirements, and standards. Review the MuleSoft System Security Plan for FedRAMP scope.


== Features Included in Government Cloud

MuleSoft Government Cloud includes the full functionality of the Anypoint Platform runtime plane (services and Mule runtime engine) and a subset of the Anypoint Platform control plane (browser-based management of APIs and Mule runtime engine instances) functionality. Government Cloud supports the full API-led connectivity methodology and end-to-end API lifecycle management.

MuleSoft Government Cloud supports Mule runtime engine v3.9 and later, with some restrictions:

* Because MuleSoft Government Cloud does not support Mule agents with self-signed certificates, specific versions of Mule agents are required:

** Mule 3: v1.12.0 and later (supported only for cloud deployments)
** Mule 4: v2.2.0 and later

For more information about creating servers with FIPS support, refer to xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[Add Servers to Runtime Manager].

By default, Mule runtime engine is configured to run in FIPS-compliant mode. See xref:mule-runtime::fips-140-2-compliance-support.adoc[FIPS 140-2 Compliance Support] for additional information.

Although Anypoint Studio is not part of Government Cloud, you can use Anypoint Studio offline to build applications and then manually deploy them to Government Cloud.
