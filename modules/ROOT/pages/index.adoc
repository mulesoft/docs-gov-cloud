MuleSoft Government Cloud is a secure, FedRAMP-compliant deployment environment that enables government agencies to use Anypoint Platform in the cloud.

 With Government Cloud, you can leverage the integration platform as a service (iPaaS) to reduce the infrastructure and management costs associated with legacy on-premises integration.

With MuleSoft managing the Anypoint Platform infrastructure, your IT teams can focus on designing integrations. You can manage and monitor all government integration assets from a single secure, cloud-based management console.
